# 🌍 Planets Database

A practice repository for learning Git and GitHub workflows through hands-on file creation, version control, and collaboration.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This repository organizes information about planets in our solar system using a simple and logical folder structure. Each planet is documented with short text files, and key planetary data is stored in a CSV file for easy comparison and analysis.

The project was built entirely using **local editing in VS Code** and **GitHub Desktop**, following professional version control practices such as small, focused commits and clear commit messages.

## 🪐 Repository Structure


---

## 📊 Data Included

- **Planet descriptions** stored as individual text files  
- **Planet statistics** (distance from the Sun, diameter, and number of moons) in CSV format  
- **Fun facts** highlighting unique characteristics of different planets  

This setup mirrors how real-world projects separate raw data from documentation.

---

## 🔁 Git Workflow Highlights

- All files were created and edited **locally** (not directly on GitHub.com)
- Changes were committed in **multiple small commits** to demonstrate good version control habits
- A merge scenario was completed to show how Git handles updates from different sources

---

## 🌟 Fun Planet Fact

Even though Mercury is closest to the Sun, **Venus is actually the hottest planet** due to its thick greenhouse-gas atmosphere.

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- **VS Code** for local file editing  
- **GitHub Desktop** for version control  
- **GitHub.com** for collaboration and repository hosting
